"As was also described in Paper II, the radial-velocity
errors among individual stars in the same cluster are not
statistically independent, but may carry a significant positive
correlation. For each star, the error contains a [nearly
constant] component being the uncertainty in the cluster
velocity as a whole, plus a random component corresponding
to the physical velocity dispersion among the individ-
ual stars. Averaging over many stars inagiven cluster
averages away the influence of the velocity dispersion, but
has only little effect on the error in the radial velocity
of the cluster centroid. This quantity, discussed already
in Paper I (e.g. its Table 4), is therefore a limiting accuracy
in the average astrometric radial velocity of stars
in any one cluster. For certain applications, effects of this
noise can be lessened by averaging over different clusters
(whose errors are not correlated), e.g., when searching for
systematic differences between astrometric and spectroscopic
radial-velocity values." (3)
