# Concerns 

"As was also described in Paper II, the radial-velocity
errors among individual stars in the same cluster are not
statistically independent, but may carry a significant positive
correlation. For each star, the error contains a [nearly
constant] component being the uncertainty in the cluster
velocity as a whole, plus a random component corresponding
to the physical velocity dispersion among the individ-
ual stars. Averaging over many stars inagiven cluster
averages away the influence of the velocity dispersion, but
has only little effect on the error in the radial velocity
of the cluster centroid. This quantity, discussed already
in Paper I (e.g. its Table 4), is therefore a limiting accuracy
in the average astrometric radial velocity of stars
in any one cluster. For certain applications, effects of this
noise can be lessened by averaging over different clusters
(whose errors are not correlated), e.g., when searching for
systematic differences between astrometric and spectroscopic
radial-velocity values[. . .] It should be noted that the selection process used to
arrive at the final sample may have a significant impact
on the estimated internal velocity dispersion. The cleaning
process successively removes those stars that deviate most
from the mean cluster velocity, thus successively reducing
σbv for the ‘cleaner’ samples. While designed to remove
non-members and other outliers, this procedure naturally
affects also the mean characteristics of the remaining stars.
For example, in the case of the Hyades, stars in the outskirts
of the cluster are preferentially removed during the
rejection procedure, meaning that the resulting clean samples
more or less correspond to the stars within the tidal
radius. " (3)
